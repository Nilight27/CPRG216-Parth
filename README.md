# F1 Driver Analysis and Prediction System

A comprehensive Python system that analyzes current Formula 1 drivers, their performance statistics, car capabilities, and calculates probabilities for race wins and championship victories using the **Jolpica F1 API**.

## Features

### üèéÔ∏è Driver Analysis
- **Current Season Stats**: Points, championship position, qualifying averages, race finishes
- **Performance Metrics**: Consistency, wet weather skill, overtaking ability, race craft
- **Car Specifications**: Engine power, aerodynamics, reliability, tire management

### üìä Probability Calculations
- **Race Win Probability**: Calculates likelihood of winning the next Grand Prix
- **Championship Probability**: Estimates championship victory chances
- **Track Type Analysis**: Different probabilities for street circuits, high-speed tracks, technical circuits

### üè¢ Team Performance
- **Team Comparisons**: Total points, average performance, car performance
- **Driver Pairings**: Analysis of teammate performance

## How to Use

### Running the Interactive System
```bash
python f1_analysis_system.py
```

This launches an interactive menu with options:
1. View Driver Comparison (Race Win & Championship Probabilities)
2. Analyze Specific Driver
3. Refresh Data from API
4. Exit

### Running the Demo
```bash
python f1_demo.py
```

This shows a comprehensive demonstration of the 2025 F1 season with real API data.

## System Components

### Driver Data Structure
Each driver includes:
- Personal info (name, team, nationality, age)
- Current season performance (points, position)
- Detailed statistics (qualifying, race finishes, podiums, wins)
- Skill ratings (consistency, wet weather, overtaking, race craft)

### Car Specifications
Each car is rated on:
- Engine Power (horsepower)
- Aerodynamics (downforce efficiency)
- Reliability (mechanical reliability)
- Tire Management (degradation resistance)
- Fuel Efficiency
- Chassis Balance

### Probability Algorithms

#### Race Win Probability
Uses weighted scoring based on:
- Driver skill (60% weight)
- Car performance (40% weight)
- Track characteristics (aerodynamics, engine power, reliability, tire management)
- Softmax normalization for probability distribution

#### Championship Probability
Considers:
- Current points and position
- Performance consistency
- Overall team/driver performance
- Points gap with races remaining

### Track Types
- **Street Circuits**: Monaco, Singapore (high aerodynamics, reliability)
- **Permanent Circuits**: Silverstone, Barcelona (balanced requirements)
- **High-Speed Tracks**: Monza, Baku (aerodynamics, engine power)
- **Technical Circuits**: Monaco, Hungary (tire management, driver skill)
